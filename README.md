# CoqIOA

## Note for CS6213

This code compiles with Coq 8.11.2. Compilation of the case studies
(e.g., `CounterNetworked.v`) takes quite some time.

## Original Note

Source code for [CoqIOA: A Formalization of IO Automata in the Coq Proof Assistant](coqioa.pdf).

This repository represents a snapshot of ongoing work. If you're doing anything
based on this, you should probably contact me (aathalye@mit.edu) to see what's
changed since this repository was published.
